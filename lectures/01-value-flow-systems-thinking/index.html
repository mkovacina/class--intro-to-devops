							## Value 
							>  ...the importance, worth, or usefulness of something... (OED)

							Notes:
							- if your customer never gets their value, you never get paid
							- not everything of value is easily measurable
								- reputation
							---
							## Value Streams

							> Concept to Cash

							Notes:
							- A value stream is the set of actions that take place to add value to a customer from the initial request through realization of value by the customer. (Book of Knowledge)
							- value derived from the perspective of the customer as opposed to the process
							---
							## Value Stream Mapping

							A visualization of the steps to realize value.

							- displays all the important steps of your work process
								- coarse grained not fine

							## Consider
							> Perfect is the enemy of the good  
							> -- Voltaire

							> Delay is preferable to error  
							> -- Thomas Jefferson

							Notes:
							- how does this relate to value?
								- what happens if you wait to long to get your product out?
								- what happens if you rush your product?
							- consider how this applies to homework and projects
