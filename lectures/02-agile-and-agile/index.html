						## Agile Manifesto
						*Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools  
						*Working software* over comprehensive documentation  
						*Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation  
						*Responding to change* over following a plan

						- 12 principles
						---
						## 12 principles

						Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer  
						through early and continuous delivery  
						of valuable software.  

						Welcome changing requirements, even late in  
						development. Agile processes harness change for  
						the customer's competitive advantage.  

						Notes:
							- https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html
						---
						## 12 principles
						Deliver working software frequently, from a  
						couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a  
						preference to the shorter timescale.  

						Business people and developers must work  
						together daily throughout the project.  
						---
						## 12 principles
						Build projects around motivated individuals.  
						Give them the environment and support they need,  
						and trust them to get the job done.  

						The most efficient and effective method of  
						conveying information to and within a development  
						team is face-to-face conversation.  
						---
						## 12 principles
						Working software is the primary measure of progress.  

						Agile processes promote sustainable development.  
						The sponsors, developers, and users should be able  
						to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.  
						---
						## 12 principles
						Continuous attention to technical excellence  
						and good design enhances agility.  

						Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount  
						of work not done--is essential.  
						---
						## 12 principles
						The best architectures, requirements, and designs  
						emerge from self-organizing teams.  

						At regular intervals, the team reflects on how  
						to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts  
						its behavior accordingly.
