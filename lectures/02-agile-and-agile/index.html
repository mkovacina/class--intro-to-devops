						## Agile Manifesto
						*Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools  
						*Working software* over comprehensive documentation  
						*Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation  
						*Responding to change* over following a plan  

						Notes:
						- https://agilemanifesto.org/
						- February 11-13, 2001, at The Lodge at Snowbird ski resort in the Wasatch mountains of Utah
						- 
						- signatories (12)
							- Kent Beck
							- Ward Cunningham
							- Martin Fowler
							- Robert C Martin (Uncle Bob)
						- 12 principles
						---
						## 12 principles

						Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer  
						through early and continuous delivery  
						of valuable software.  

						Welcome changing requirements, even late in  
						development. Agile processes harness change for  
						the customer's competitive advantage.  

						Notes:
							- https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html
						---
						## 12 principles
						Deliver working software frequently, from a  
						couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a  
						preference to the shorter timescale.  

						Business people and developers must work  
						together daily throughout the project.  
						---
						## 12 principles
						Build projects around motivated individuals.  
						Give them the environment and support they need,  
						and trust them to get the job done.  

						The most efficient and effective method of  
						conveying information to and within a development  
						team is face-to-face conversation.  
						---
						## 12 principles
						Working software is the primary measure of progress.  

						Agile processes promote sustainable development.  
						The sponsors, developers, and users should be able  
						to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.  
						---
						## 12 principles
						Continuous attention to technical excellence  
						and good design enhances agility.  

						Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount  
						of work not done--is essential.  
						---
						## 12 principles
						The best architectures, requirements, and designs  
						emerge from self-organizing teams.  

						At regular intervals, the team reflects on how  
						to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts  
						its behavior accordingly.

						## Extreme Programming (XP)
						
						> lightweight, efficient , low-risk, flexible predictable, scientific, and fun way to develop software  
						> -- Kent Beck 

						Notes:
						- http://www.extremeprogramming.org/
						- Ward Cunningham, Kent Beck, Ron Jeffries 
						- "Extreme Software Engineering: A Hands-On Approach" by Steinberg and Palmer
						---
						## Extreme Programming
						- communication
						- simplicity
						- feedback
						- respect
						- courage

						Notes:
						- constant communication with customers and teams
						- simple designs (yup)
						- early and often feedback from testing (customer feedback)
						- accumulation of little wins builds the team and team/customer relationship
						- honest with self and customer about abilities and timelines
						---
						## 13 practices
						- Whole Team 
						- Metaphor 
						- The Planning Game
						- Simple Design

						Notes:
						- no barrier between team and customer, or dev and qa and manager; whole unit 
						- same domain language (e.g., desktop)
						- user stories and estimates
						- KISS / YAGNI / MVP 
						---
						## 13 practices
						- Small Releases
						- Customer Tests
						- Pair Programming
						- Test-driven Development

						Notes:
						- little bites, needed to be agile/nimble 
						- customer acceptance tests of the small releases...feedback
						- driver and the RIO (see "Top Gun")
						- automated tests before production code
						---
						## 13 practices
						- Design Improvement
						- Collective Code Ownership 
						- Continuous Integration 
						- Sustainable Pace 
						- Coding Standards

						Notes:
						- refactor as you go; compare with "simple design"; balance local optimization
						- it is not "your" code
						- if it's not green, it's not getting into production 
						- overtime leads to mistakes, burnout and....more overtime
							- hero moves
						- the code should look like a single developer authored it

						## Scrum

						 - User Stories
						 - Product Backlog
						 - Sprint Backlog
						 - Sprint

						Notes: 
						 - name from Rugby 
						 - product owner writes user stories based on customer input 
						 - stories to the product backlog
						 - sprint backlog is what is committed to for an iteration

						---

						## Scrum Cycle (A sprint)
						 1. Sprint Planning
						 2. Daily Scrum 
						 3. Sprint review
						 4. Sprint Retrospective 

						---

						## Scrum Master

						 - identify and fix bottlenecks
						 - facilitator  
						  
						  
						 emerging term: agile coach

						Notes:
						- agile coach is a much better descriptor
						- there is immense and hidden value in a coach for any aspect of life

					## When does agile "not work"?

					> any program will work,  
					>   if you work the program

					Notes:
					- there is a line between customizing and hubris
					---
					## "Agile"

					agile as an enterprise tool

					Notes:
					- agile as a buzzword 
					- agile as a form of "signaling"
					- if it works for smaller problems, why not bigger
						- because not all algorithms scale nicely...
					- SAFe as an example 
					---
					## Weaponizing Agile
					> agile is about software development, not managing software development

					- daily standup as a status report
					- metrics used to "identify problems"
					- won't fix a broken culture
