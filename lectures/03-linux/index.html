						## Linux

						Notes:
						- linux and the command line are standard now
						- better to learn it now when you have time 
						- DevOps is very Linux and command-line heavy

						<textarea data-template data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
						## Unix

						- Bell Labs, 1969
						- rewritten in C in 1973 to be portable (pre-OSS)
						- popular with academics due to AT&T being required to license source code to anyone who asked
						- Minix by Andrew Tanenbaum as a "unix-like" clone for academic purposes

						Notes:
						- portability was a key factor to the success and popularity

						---

						## Linus Torvalds

						- University student in 1991
						- unhappy with "academic use only" for Minix 
						- decided to create his own kernel
						- using Minix to build his kernel
						- slowly replaced Minix based tools with GNU tools

						---

						## Linux and Open Source 

						- gained popularity due to unix compatiblity without the licensing 
						- open source meant that people could fix their own problems
						- more importantly, they could contribute back 
						- written in C meant portability 
						- high quality and zero cost = popularity 
						- opened the door for moving to more commodity hardware for higher-end applications

						## In the beginning,  
						## there was the command line

						Notes:
						- Book of the same name by NEal Stephenson: https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Was-Command-Line-ebook/dp/B0011GA08E/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=in+the+beginning+there+was+the+command+line&qid=1631506552&s=books&sr=1-1
						- examples of command-lines
							- DOS on Windows
							- PowerShell on Windows
							- Terminal on MacOS
						---

						# Shells

						- a shell is a command interpreter
						- `sh` is a POSIX standard definition
						- most (all?) Unix/Linux distributions including an `sh` compatible shell by default
						- `bash` (Bourne Again Shell) is a popular default 
						- why called "a terminal"?

						Notes:
						- POSIX: portable operating system interface (IEEE)
						- there are many different shells because everyone has an opinion
						- there are others though 
							- `dash`, `ash`, `fish`, `zsh`, `ksh`
						- TTY (teleprinter), line-oriented p2p comm. mechanism (humans to humans, then human to computer)
							- paper printer replaced with a screen

						---

						## Parts of a shell

						- prompt
						- command 
						- arguments

						`#> cat REAMDE`

						Notes:
						- REAMDE: https://www.amazon.com/Reamde-Novel-Neal-Stephenson/dp/0062191497
						- `cat` from con'cat'enate

						---
						# Redirection

						`#> cat REAMDE > data.txt`

						Notes:
						- redirects the (Standard) output to a file
						---
						## Input not from arguments

						`#> cat -`

						Notes:
						- reads arguments from standard input
						---
						# More Redirection

						`#> cat - < REAMDE`

						Notes:
						- the contents of the file REAMDE are written to standard input for consumption by the command 
						---
						## Piping

						`#> cat REAMDE | grep unix`

						Notes:
						- the output from the first command is "piped" into the standard input of the second command

						# Summary
						
						- Linux is the expectation for most new greenfield DevOps
						- DevOps or not, you need to be comfortable on the command line
