					## GitHub Actions
				
					automation for tasks in  
					your software development lifecycle

					Notes:
					remember why we want automation: consistency, decrease cognitive load, let people work on the important stuff
					---
					## Development Cycle (refresh)
					develop  
					test  
					deploy  
					release

						## What can you do with GitHub actions?

						- automate testing
						- automate deployment
						- send notifications
						- almost anything you can automate
						---
						## workflows

						- A <b>Workflow<b/> is a collection of jobs that are executed in parallel
						- A <b></B>Job</b> is a collection steps executed serially
						- A <b></b>Step</b> is a task that runs an Action or shell command
						- An <b>Action</b> are standalone commands
						---
						## Event Driven

						- when an event is detected, a workflow is executed
						- examples of events
							- a new pull request is made
							- something changes in another repo
							- a schedule/timer
						- flexible model
						- sequencing can be difficult if needed
						---
						## Overview of Execution

						scenario: checking in code should trigger a build

						step 0: configure your repository to listen for check-in events and build (more later)
						step 1: check in your code 
						step 2: GitHub Action engine find all workflows associated
						- configure your repo 
						- an event occurs (e.g., code is checked-in)

						## A continuum of continuous... 

						- "continuous development"
						- continuous integration
						- continuous delivery
						- continuous deployment
						---
						### Continuous Integration

						- focuses on the running of automated tests
							- unit test
							- integration test 
						- ideally tests are executed for each check-in
							- what to do with a large codebase
						---
						### Continuous Delivery
						
						- builds off of Continuous Integration
						- each check-in results in software that is ready to ship
							- this can mean "delivered to the shelf"
							- this can mean "waiting for a manual process" as the next step
						- the software does not get automatically deployed
						---
						### Continuous Deployment

						- builds off of Continuous Delivery
						- each check-in is automatically deployed to production

						## Continuous Improvement
						
						yes, this again...  
						---
						## Short Cycles

						- Why short cycles
							- short cycles means faster feedback
							- short cycles means more manageable feedback
							- short cycles mean "smaller bites"
								- smaller changes are easier to review
								- smaller changes tend to be safer
								- smaller changes easier to fix (or revert...)
						---
						## Feedback Driven

						- to improve you need to understand where you need to improve
							- ...insightful 
						- feedback is used to drive changes
							- "experiments" are a popular way to view changes
						- feedback is useful
							- judgement is not
						---
						## Predictable

						- nothing is special anymore
							- in this case...boring is good
						- variation is a cost
							- think about "utilization" from Phoenix
						- discipline
						---
						## Automation

						- testing 
						- deployment 
						- monitoring

						## How it can break down 

						- insufficient automated testing
							- leads to lack of confidence
						- environmental differences
							- issues in production not seen in test
						- culture change is a long journey
							- undoing years of conditioning is difficult
							- legacy technology isn't the only legacy problem
						---
						## How it can break down 
						
						- organizational misalignment
							- everyone needs to be rowing in the same direction
						- delivering "too fast"
							- customers don't like or want it
							- regulations prevent it
							- human intervention required for verification (can't be automated)
