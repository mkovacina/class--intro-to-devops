						## Welcome to CS480A
						## Introduction to DevOps
						
						Mike Kovacina
						
						michael.kovacina@gmail.com

						Notes:
						1. The goal of this class is to give you a conversational understanding of the philosophies and technologies that comprise the current state of DevOps
						2. subgoal of making you more marketable
						3. instructor background

						# Class Structure
						
						- Lectures on philosophical topics
						- Practical demonstrations of some key tools and technologies
						- Reading "The Phoenix Project" 
							- "experience" a DevOps transformation
						- Hands-on practical assignments
					
						Notes:
						There is a lot (a lot) to DevOps...we can only make a tiny dent, but I hope to impart enough momentum that you can keep going.

						Material from this class comes from research, experience and the "DevOps Handbook" (buy it after december)

						Will require some research and self-learning...welcome to the real world.
						
						Google and StackOverflow

						Collaboration is encouraged...just don't copy.  Be adults.  It's okay to ask for help (me or others).

						The goal is understanding

							# What is DevOps?
							
							> DevOps is the outcome of applying the most trusted principles from the domain of physical manufacturing and IT to the IT value stream 
							
							[DevOps Handbook, p.4](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations/dp/1942788002/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=devops+handbook&qid=1630131913&sr=8-1)
							Notes:
							---
							# What is DevOps?
							> DevOps is a software development practice that promotes collaboration between development and operations, resulting in faster and more reliable software delivery. Commonly referred to as a culture, DevOps connects people, process, and technology to deliver continuous value.
							
							[Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/devops-tutorial/)
							---
							# "Dev"
							- Waterfall
								- upfront planning
								- deliver when done
							- Agile
								- iterative
								- deliver along the way
							Notes: 
							- Rooted in agile
							- Waterfall was not responsive to changes.
								- this isn't manufacturing where changes had physical cost (this cuts both ways)
							- Agile, will touch more on in a later class
							---
							# "Ops"
							![the assembly line](assets/images/assembly-line.jpg)

							> “What gets measured gets managed.” (Peter Drucker)
							Notes:
							- Henry Ford effectively operationalized the assembly line
							- neither development nor operations is a linear assembly
							- measuring is required for improvement
							- question: what can you measure?
								- quality (Defect rate), performance, cost, speed, ROM satisfaction (happy or not)

							# Why DevOps?
							## Value 
							>  ...the importance, worth, or usefulness of something... (OED)

							Notes:
							- if your customer never gets their value, you never get paid
							---
							# Why DevOps?
							![over the fence](assets/images/over-the-fence.jpg)
							Notes:
							- still following an assembly line mentality 
							- corporations split into silos with budgets and individual agendas
							---
							# The Cast of Characters
							- developers
							- testers/quality assurance (QA)
							- operations (IT)
							- product owners 
							- "management"
							- customers
							Notes:
							- question: name some examples of customers 
							---
							# Example problems
							- the developers never installed their software
							- the developers never tested their software
								- at all
								- on production hardware
								- at scale with load
							- development delays put a crunch on operations
							- what the software does isn't what the customer wants
							---
							# Feedback Loops
							
							![feedback loops](assets/images/feedback-loops.png)
							 Notes:
							 - yes, increasing communication means you need to get better at it...continually
							---
							# Feedback Loops
							
							![forward spiral](assets/images/forward-spiral.png)
							 Notes:
							 - feedback is what drives improvement
							 - the impossible goal of perfection

							# How DevOps?
							> Form follows function (Louis Sullivan)

							> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure. (Melvin Conway)
							
							Notes:
							- sullivan was an architect, 19th century
							---
							# When to start?
							- if not at the start, then now
							- debt is real	
								- tech, product, security...
							Notes:
							- the world is rarely ideal, even at a startup (constraints)
							- the debts are variations on the same theme of value
							---
							# Transformations
							- it is difficult to turn a big ship
							- build a coalition up, down, and across your organization
							- work for an agreed upon understanding of the value delivered
							- identify a target state
							- identify transition transition states 
							- iterate, measure, adapt
							- avoid the temptation of cynicism :)

						# Summary
						- Continuous improvement of the delivery of value
						- Culture over technology
						- The sooner the easier
						Notes:
						- technology is necessary but not sufficient
							- it just makes some things easier (avoid reinventing the wheel)
						- tech debt is subject to compounded interest
							- tech debt slows you down
