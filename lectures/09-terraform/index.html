					## Terraform by HashiCorp
				
					> an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. This includes low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc.

					Notes:
					remember why we want automation: consistency, decrease cognitive load, let people work on the important stuff

						## infrastructure as code (IaC)

						- the management of infrastructure in a descriptive model 
						- uses version control
						- solves the problem of environment drift in the release pipeline ("snowflakes")
						- teams make changes to the environment description, not the environment itself

						Notes:
						- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code
						- phoenix, dev not the same as test not the same as production
							- this is something Brent would want to use (or build)
						---
						## terraform

						- IaC tool by HashiCorp
						- open source
						- declarative model using HCL HashiCorp Configuration Language
							- define your desired state 
							- terraform figures out how to make it happen
						- flexible plugin-style model

						Notes:
						- procedural versus declarative
						---
						## provider

						- add a set of resource types and/or data sources that Terraform can manage
						- https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers
