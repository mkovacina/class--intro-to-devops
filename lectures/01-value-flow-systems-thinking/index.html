						## Value, Flow, and Systems Thinking

						- probably the most abstract that the class will get
						- some stuff obvious on the surface, but recursively apply

						## ProTip

						Be the note taker

						![the scribe](assets/images/scribe.jpg)

						Notes:
						- someone has to do it
						- it is important work
						- it provides value because a meeting without notes (and action items) could probably have been an email
						- a good way to grind character and reputation points
						- doing what others don't want to do (below them?) is a good way to get ahead
						- those who write control what is read

					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
							## Value 
							>  ...the importance, worth, or usefulness of something... (OED)

							Notes:
							- if your customer never gets their value, you never get paid
							- not everything of value is easily measurable
								- reputation
							---
							## Value Streams

							> Concept to Cash

							Notes:
							- A value stream is the set of actions that take place to add value to a customer from the initial request through realization of value by the customer. (Book of Knowledge)
							- value derived from the perspective of the customer as opposed to the process
							---
							## Value Stream Mapping

							A visualization of the steps to realize value.

							Notes: 
							- displays all the important steps of your work process
								- coarse grained not fine
							- find efficiencies and waste
							- example using the process of doing homework (get the assignment, identify research, organize research, draft, review, submit)
							---
							## Example
							Customer Request => Product Manager => Product Owner => Backlog => Dev => Documentation => Marketing => Deploy => Go Live
							---
							## Example

							![value stream](assets/images/value-stream.png)

							> https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/microsites/disciplined-agile/flex-workflow1.png
							---
							## Consider
							> Perfect is the enemy of the good  
							> -- Voltaire

							> Delay is preferable to error  
							> -- Thomas Jefferson

							Notes:
							- how does this relate to value?
								- what happens if you wait to long to get your product out?
								- what happens if you rush your product?
							- consider how this applies to homework and projects

					<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
						<textarea data-template>
						## Flow

						water, electricity, network, cash...and value
						
						Notes:
						- the all are similar in that they are moving through time
						- flow too low
							- get stuck
						- flow too high 
							- waste, damage
						- to flow is to have control
						---
						## Flow (psychology)

						![flow](assets/images/flow.jpg)

						Mihály Csíkszentmihályi

						Notes:
						- where challenge and skill are balanced
						- "the zone"
							- distractions melt away
						- a type of focus where there is balance

						---

						## DevOps Flow

						agility and continuous improvement in the service of delivering value

						Notes:
						- skills: programming, automation, finding bottlenecks, planning
						- challenges: moving targets, moving deadlines, outages, stability without stagnation

				<!-- Systems Thinking -->
				<section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
					## Systems Thinking

					> a multi-disciplinary, holistic approach to understanding complex systems that focuses on the *interactions* between the components of the system

					Notes:
					- examples: university, economies, this class, swarms
					- complex systems have many interactions and feedback loops
					- more than the sum of the parts 

					---

					## Systems Thinking

					Solving problems in complex systems

					*If I change A,  
					that impacts B,  
					which impacts C,  
					... that modifies A* 

					Notes:
					- an eco system
					- actions and their consequences
					- chickens and pigs 
					- supply and demand
					- related rates problems from calculus
					- synergy and emergent behavior
					- Macro and micro behaviors

					---
					## Incentives

					> Show me the incentive and I will show you the outcome  
					> -- Charlie Munger

					Notes:
					- To understand an interaction you must know the why
					- training neural nets poorly
					- Xerox, new versus old machines, sales incentives

					---
					
					## ...DevOps 

					- the cast of characters
					- the value streams and mappings
					- maximizing flow  
					
					> ...a software development practice that promotes collaboration between development and operations...

					**The process of delivering software is a complex system**

				<!-- Summary -->
				<section data-markdown>
					<textarea data-template data-separator-notes="^Notes:">
						# Summary
						- concept to cash 
						- fast Flow
						- complex interactions and outcomes

						## assignment
						- Chapters 1-3 for next Wednesday (on Canvas too)
						Notes:
						- technology is necessary but not sufficient
							- it just makes some things easier (avoid reinventing the wheel)
						- tech debt is subject to compounded interest
							- tech debt slows you down
