					> an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently

					Notes:
					- remember why we want automation: consistency, decrease cognitive load, let people work on the important stuff
					- This includes low-level components such as compute instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, etc.

						## infrastructure as code (IaC)

						- the management of infrastructure in a descriptive model 
						- uses version control
						- solves the problem of environment drift in the release pipeline ("snowflakes")
						- teams make changes to the environment description, not the environment itself

						Notes:
						- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code
						- phoenix, dev not the same as test not the same as production
							- this is something Brent would want to use (or build)
						---
						## terraform

						- IaC tool by HashiCorp
						- open source
						- declarative model using HCL HashiCorp Configuration Language
							- define your desired state 
							- terraform figures out how to make it happen
						- flexible plugin-style model

						Notes:
						- procedural versus declarative
						---
						## provider

						- add a set of resource types and/or data sources that Terraform can manage

						---
						## example providers
						<code>

							provider "docker" {
							}

							provider "aws" {
								region = "us-east-2"
							  }
						</code>
						---
						## marketplace

						https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers

						---
						
						## resource

						<code>

							resource "<PROVIDER>_<TYPE>" "<NAME>" {
								[CONFIG â€¦]
							   }

						</code>
						---
						<code>

							resource "aws_instance" "example" {
								ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
								instance_type = "t2.micro"
							  }

							resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
								name         = "nginx:latest"
								keep_locally = false
							  }

						</code>
						---
						# tf file

						- start with a `main.tf` by convention
						- can have multiple files (don't need one big file)

						---
						# command: init

						- initializes the working directory which consists of all the configuration files
						- creates a .terraform folder in the directory

						> terraform init
						---
						# command: plan

						creates an execution plan to reach a desired state of the infrastructure

						> terraform plan
						---
						# command: apply

						- makes the changes in the infrastructure as defined in the plan
						- brings the infrastructure comes to the desired state
						- stores the state of the infrastructure (e.g., `terraform.tfstate`)

						> terraform apply
