					## Site Reliability Engineering 
				
					> hope is not a strategy

					Notes:
					https://sre.google/sre-book/introduction/remember 
					quote listed as a "traditional" SRE saying
					---
					# What is SRE?

					> SRE is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations team
						(Ben Treynor Sloss, VP of engineering at Google)

					- use of software engineering principles and automation
					- using software to solve complex problems
					- manage production systems
					- augements a production team

					> responsible for the availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning of their service(s)
					---
					# DevOps versus SRE

					- overlap in the use of automation, involvement of IT, and focusing on "good engineering" practices
					
					Notes:
					devops can be seen as a generalization of SRE with a broader organizational impact
					SRE can be seen as a specialization of DevOps with a more specific set of ideals

						## Tenets

						(from Google SRE, since that's where it started)
						---
						## Focus on engineering

						- limit the the amount of operational work
						- ensure a minimum amount of "coding time" on projects
							- excess work goes back to the development team 

						Notes:
						- requires monitoring of the amount and types of work coming in 
						---
						## Maximum acceptable (feature) change velocity

						- 100% availability impossible
							- 99.999%...what is the cost of the 0.001%
							- does the user notice?
						- error budget tied to availability
						- spend the error budget to maximize feature velocity
							- if software is flaky, no "budget" for new features/innovation
						- reframes an outage as part of the innovation process
						---
						## Monitoring
						- Alerts
						- Tickets
						- Logging
