						## Development Cycle
						develop  
						test  
						deploy  
						release

						Notes:
						Yes, here I am skipping  planning, architecting, security,etc.
						Those are qualities that can be seen as cross-cutting these 4 stages for the purposes of this disucssion
						---
						## Why
						
						minimize the time to deliver quality software 
						---
						## Benefits

						- better software faster
							- reduced risk
							- higher quality
							- quicker to market
						- reduced cost through automation	
						---
						## Benefits

						- releasable at any time
						- more product flexibility 
							- A/B testing, etc
							- feature flags
							- dark launches
						---
						## Benefits

						- Enables high performance TEAM
							- reduces burnout
							- reduces pain
							- automate the boring stuff
							- time to talk to customers (Feedback)
								-ok, maybe not always "talk" but get feedback

						## A continuum of continuous... 

						- "continuous development"
						- continuous integration
						- continuous delivery
						- continuous deployment
						---
						### Continuous Integration

						- focuses on the running of automated tests
							- unit test
							- integration test 
						- ideally tests are executed for each check-in
							- what to do with a large codebase
						---
						### Continuous Delivery
						
						- builds off of Continuous Integration
						- each check-in results in software that is ready to ship
							- this can mean "delivered to the shelf"
							- this can mean "waiting for a manual process" as the next step
						- the software does not get automatically deployed
						---
						### Continuous Deployment

						- builds off of Continuous Delivery
						- each check-in is automatically deployed to production

						## Continuous Improvement
						
						yes, this again...  
						---
						## Short Cycles

						- Why short cycles
							- short cycles means faster feedback
							- short cycles means more manageable feedback
							- short cycles mean "smaller bites"
								- smaller changes are easier to review
								- smaller changes tend to be safer
								- smaller changes easier to fix (or revert...)
						---
						## Feedback Driven

						- to improve you need to understand where you need to improve
							- ...insightful 
						- feedback is used to drive changes
							- "experiments" are a popular way to view changes
						- feedback is useful
							- judgement is not
						---
						## Predictable

						- nothing is special anymore
							- in this case...boring is good
						- variation is a cost
							- think about "utilization" from Phoenix
						- discipline
						---
						## Automation

						- testing 
						- deployment 
						- monitoring

						## How it can break down 

						- insufficient automated testing
							- leads to lack of confidence
						- environmental differences
							- issues in production not seen in test
						- culture change is a long journey
							- undoing years of conditioning is difficult
							- legacy technology isn't the only legacy problem
						---
						## How it can break down 
						
						- organizational misalignment
							- everyone needs to be rowing in the same direction
						- delivering "too fast"
							- customers don't like or want it
							- regulations prevent it
							- human intervention required for verification (can't be automated)
